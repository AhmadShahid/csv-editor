# CSV Editor

Edit your CSV data with no hassle.
A simple utility that you can use to edit (Delete rows, update, Sort etc) your CSV files

## Why I created this? 
Because I had a few moments of free time and creating a utility that may help me (and you?!) in my usual activity of playing with CSV files in order to migrate data seemed like a good idea.

## How to use?

- Clone the repository or download the zip (whatever you prefer)
- Put the project wherever your server can access it
- Make sure that the `temp` directory has write permissions
- Point to the project in your browser and follow the steps in the below snapshot

Or what you can do is navigate to this heroku app at [http://csv-editor.herokuapp.com/](http://csv-sorter.herokuapp.com/) and do your processing there.

## Known Issues

- **Quality of Code** The quality of code is not perfect at all. I just sat and unleashed my hands to the keyboard so please ignore it and do not make any judgements based upon the code quality.
- **No validations or exception handling** There are no validations or exception handling stuff and it expects that happy path is followed.

## Upcoming features
You should expect following soon.

- Generating SQL Queries
- Generating XML file
- Drag table columns
- Add rows
- Rename table headers
- ..etc
