# CSV Editor

Edit your CSV data with no hassle.
A simple utility that you can use to perform the following operations on your CSV files:

- Update rows
- Sort rows by columns
- Delete rows

**Why I created this?** because I had a few minutes of free time today and I usually find myself playing with CSV files removing redundant data, compiling it from several files ordering it to make sense of data in order to migrate data and this little utility will come handy next time.

## How to use?

- Clone the repository or download the zip (whatever you prefer)
- Put the project wherever your server can access it
- Make sure that the `temp` directory has write permissions
- Point to the project in your browser and follow the steps in the below snapshot

Or what you can do is navigate to this heroku app at [http://csv-editor.herokuapp.com/](http://csv-sorter.herokuapp.com/) and do your processing there.

## Known Issues

- **Quality of Code** The quality of code is not perfect at all. I just sat and unleashed my hands to the keyboard so please ignore it and do not make any judgements based upon the code quality.
- **No validations or exception handling** There are no validations or exception handling stuff and it expects that happy path is followed.
